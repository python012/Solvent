Hi, this is the project I practice building an Automation testing framework. I mainly use Java, Selenium Webdriver and Junit, and it's a maven project, I'm reading a book about how to build automation testing framework and thanks so much to this book!

Hope I can make it before my baby bores in this summer:)
